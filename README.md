# Enhancing Spacecraft Battery Efficiency with Loop Heat Pipe and Phase Change Material Technologies

## Abstract

Efficient and dependable energy storage technologies are essential for powering spacecraft systems during space exploration. Batteries serve as critical components, supplying power during vital mission phases when solar energy is unavailable. However, traditional battery technologies face challenges such as low energy density, temperature sensitivity, and degradation with continuous use. 

This project presents an innovative approach that combines Phase Change Material (PCM) and Loop Heat Pipe (LHP) technologies to enhance battery efficiency for space applications. LHPs provide efficient thermal management by removing heat from sensitive components, while PCMs help control temperature swings within battery enclosures. This research investigates these technologies and their integration into battery systems, highlighting potential benefits in longevity, performance, and dependability.

Practical considerations and design techniques for implementing LHP and PCM solutions are explored to address thermal issues and maximize battery efficiency for upcoming space missions. By effectively managing heat and temperature fluctuations, this integrated strategy aims to enhance overall battery performance and longevity in the demanding conditions of space.

## Objectives

- Evaluate the effectiveness of LHP and PCM technologies in managing battery temperatures.
- Analyze the performance of different coolant mixtures (Ethylene Glycol and Water, Water Only, Propylene Glycol and Water) in conjunction with LHP systems.
- Assess the impact of increased cold plate area on cooling efficiency.

## Methodology

1. **Experimental Setup**: 
   - Integrate LHP thermal management systems with spacecraft battery packs utilizing various coolant mixtures.
   - Conduct experiments to monitor temperature profiles and energy consumption.

2. **Data Collection**: 
   - Measure radiator inlet and outlet temperatures, battery pack temperatures, and energy consumption (pump and refrigerant power).

3. **Analysis**: 
   - Analyze experimental data to draw insights on the performance of each cooling method and configuration.

## Key Findings

- **LHP and PCM Integration**:
  - Efficiently manages battery temperatures, extending operational life and enhancing performance.
